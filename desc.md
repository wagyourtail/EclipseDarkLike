This theme is designed to more faithfully replicate the color pallete of Eclipse's Dark theme for java code, with some minor changes for code readability. 

Notable changes: 
* Slight desaturation from the true colors in eclipse, this makes the text appear more similar in-editor. 
* certain functions in eclipse not working with IDEA's color options 
* Added underlines to final/effectively final values in methods, this can easily be changed in the java color style section, Java->Parameters->Parameter and un-check "Effects" as well as Variables->Local Variable.
* I also left javadoc hilighting alone as Dracula's hilighting's a bit nicer in my opinion.
* error hilighting is not completely fixed as that isn't part of theme but is under "Inspections"
